### Project
<p>In this projrct will process the event_datafile_new.csv dataset to create a denormalized dataset
 1.model the data tables keeping in mind the queries you need to run
 2.provide queries that you will need to model your data tables for
 3.load the data into tables created in Apache Cassandra and run queries

  Project Steps
Modeling NoSQL database or Apache Cassandra database
Design tables to answer the queries outlined in the project template
Write Apache Cassandra CREATE KEYSPACE and SET KEYSPACE statements
Develop your CREATE statement for each of the tables to address each question
Load the data with INSERT statement for each of the tables
Build ETL Pipeline
Implement the logic in section Part I of the notebook template to iterate through each event file in event_data to process and create a new CSV file in Python
Make necessary edits to Part II of the notebook template to include Apache Cassandra CREATE and INSERT statements to load processed records into relevant tables in  data model
